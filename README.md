## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

The goal is simple: serve as many customers as you can before the time runs out! 

- **Check the Order:** Customers will arrive and queue up. Look at the icon above their head to see if they want a ‚òï (coffee), a ü•ê (croissant), or both!
- **Grab the Item:** Run to the coffee machine or the croissant oven to pick up the required item. You can only hold one thing at a time!
- **Serve the Customer:** Rush back to the counter and serve the correct customer.
- **Don't Mess Up the Queue!** Customers must be served in the order they arrived (from left to right). Serving someone out of turn will make the waiting customers angry, and they'll leave, costing you points!
- **Mistakes Happen:** Grabbed the wrong item? Just drop it in the trash can and grab a new one.
